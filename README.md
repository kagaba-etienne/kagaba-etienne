# Hello, World! 👋

I'm a full-stack web developer with a passion for AI and a love for dogs 🐶. My tech stack includes Python 🐍, JavaScript 🌐, C++, C 🖥️, and more.

## My Skills 💻

Here are some of the technologies and tools I work with:

* 🌐 **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular
* 🖥️ **Back-end:** Python (Django, Flask), Node.js (Express.js)
* 🗃️ **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* 🤖 **AI/ML:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn, OpenCV
* 🛠️ **Other tools:** Git, Docker, AWS, Heroku, Firebase, REST APIs

## Fun Fact 😄

Did you know that dogs have a sense of time? They can sense how long you've been away and will greet you accordingly when you return home 🕰️.

## What I Love ❤️

When I'm not coding, I'm often exploring the outdoors or trying out new cuisines. I'm also a fan of gadgets and enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends.
